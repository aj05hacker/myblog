                <p><b>The Titans of the Cosmos</b></p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Supermassive black holes, the colossal giants at the hearts of galaxies, are among the most awe-inspiring objects in the universe. These behemoths possess masses millions to billions of times that of our Sun, yet they occupy a space that, comparatively, would fit inside our solar system. The most famous example is Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, which plays a pivotal role in the dynamics of our galaxy.</p>
                        <p>The formation of these black holes remains one of the great mysteries of astrophysics. Scientists believe that they might grow by accreting vast amounts of gas and merging with other black holes. The immense gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole can warp space and time around it, leading to phenomena such as gravitational lensing, where the black hole's gravity bends the light from objects behind it.</p>
                        <p>Despite their name, black holes are not empty spaces; they are incredibly dense regions of spacetime with a gravitational pull so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape once it crosses the event horizon. This boundary marks the point of no return, beyond which all information is lost to the universe. The study of supermassive black holes provides crucial insights into the evolution of galaxies and the fundamental laws governing the cosmos.</p>
                        <p>These cosmic titans are also responsible for some of the most energetic phenomena in the universe, including quasars—galactic nuclei powered by accretion of material onto supermassive black holes, emitting vast amounts of energy and often outshining entire galaxies. Their role in shaping the universe as we know it continues to be a subject of intense research and fascination.</p>

                <h2>2. Stellar Black Holes</h2>
                <p><b>The Remnants of Massive Stars</b></p>
                <div class="content">
                    <img src="./images/stellar.svg" alt="Stellar Black Hole">
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Stellar black holes are the remnants of massive stars that have ended their life cycles in spectacular supernova explosions. When a star with more than about 20 times the mass of the Sun exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer support itself against the force of its own gravity. The core collapses, and if the core's mass is sufficient, it forms a black hole. These black holes typically have masses ranging from a few to a few tens of solar masses.</p>
                        <p>Though much smaller than their supermassive counterparts, stellar black holes are equally intriguing. They often exist in binary systems, where they can pull matter from a companion star. This infalling material forms an accretion disk around the black hole, heating up and emitting X-rays that can be detected by telescopes. Cygnus X-1, located in the Milky Way, is one of the most studied stellar black holes and was the first to be widely accepted as a black hole by the scientific community.</p>
                        <p>The detection of gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime caused by the collision of stellar black holes, has opened a new window into the study of these fascinating objects. In 2015, the LIGO observatory made the first-ever detection of gravitational waves from a merging black hole binary, confirming a major prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity.</p>
                        <p>Stellar black holes also play a significant role in the life cycles of galaxies. By consuming nearby material and growing larger, they contribute to the enrichment of the interstellar medium with heavy elements, which are essential for the formation of new stars and planets. These remnants of massive stars continue to captivate scientists and enthusiasts alike as we strive to understand their properties and their place in the cosmos.</p>

                <h2>3. Primordial Black Holes</h2>
                <p><b>Relics of the Early Universe</b></p>
                <div class="content">
                    <img src="./images/primordial.svg" alt="Primordial Black Hole">
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Primordial black holes are hypothetical black holes that are thought to have formed in the early universe, shortly after the Big Bang. Unlike supermassive and stellar black holes, which form from the collapse of massive stars or the merging of smaller black holes, primordial black holes could have formed from the extreme density fluctuations in the universe's infancy. These black holes might be as small as an atom or as large as a mountain, depending on the conditions during their formation.</p>
                        <p>The existence of primordial black holes remains unconfirmed, but they are a subject of considerable interest because they could potentially solve some of the most pressing mysteries in cosmology. For instance, they are considered as candidates for dark matter, the unseen substance that makes up about 27% of the universe's mass-energy content. If primordial black holes exist, they could account for a significant fraction of dark matter.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, primordial black holes could offer insights into the conditions of the early universe, a period that is still largely shrouded in mystery. If these black holes were detected, they could provide valuable information about the processes that occurred just fractions of a second after the Big Bang, offering clues about the formation of the first galaxies and the evolution of the cosmos.</p>
                        <p>Detecting primordial black holes is challenging due to their potential size and the difficulty in distinguishing them from other astrophysical phenomena. However, ongoing research and observations, including searches for microlensing events and gravitational waves, continue to push the boundaries of our understanding of these elusive objects. The discovery of primordial black holes would be a monumental breakthrough, shedding light on the dark corners of the universe's history.</p>
