                <h2>1. Myth 1: Carbs Are Bad for You</h2>
                <p><b>Understanding Carbohydrates</b></p>
                <div class="content">
                    <img src="images/carbs.jpg" alt="Carbohydrates" style="width:100%; height:auto;">

                        <p>
                            One of the most prevalent misconceptions in nutrition is that carbohydrates are inherently bad for health. In reality, carbohydrates are a primary source of energy for our bodies. They are essential for the proper functioning of our brain, muscles, and organs. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's important to distinguish between complex carbohydrates, like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, which are beneficial, and simple carbohydrates, such as sugary snacks and beverages, which can lead to health issues if consumed in excess. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead of eliminating carbs, focusing on the quality and source of carbohydrates can lead to better health outcomes. Whole, unprocessed carbohydrates provide vital nutrients and should be a staple in a balanced diet.

                <h2>2. Myth 2: Eating Fat Makes You Fat</h2>
                <p><b>The Truth About Dietary Fats</b></p>
                <div class="content">
                    <img src="images/fat.jpg" alt="Dietary Fats" style="width:100%; height:auto;">                    
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>
                            Another common myth is that consuming dietary fat directly leads to weight gain. However, dietary fats are an essential part of a healthy diet and play critical roles in hormone production, nutrient absorption, and overall health. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The key is understanding the difference between healthy fats, such as those found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil, and unhealthy fats, such as trans fats and excessive saturated fats found in processed foods. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Incorporating healthy fats into your diet can actually promote satiety, helping you feel full and satisfied, which may prevent overeating and aid in weight management.

                <h2>3. Myth 3: Supplements Can Replace Healthy Foods</h2>
                <p><b>The Role of Whole Foods in Nutrition</b></p>
                <div class="content">
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>
                            Many people believe that dietary supplements can provide all the nutrients needed for optimal health. However, whole foods contain a complex array of vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals that supplements cannot replicate. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A well-rounded diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins provides not only essential nutrients but also fiber and antioxidants that support overall health. Supplements can be beneficial in certain cases, but they should not be seen as a replacement for a healthy diet.

                <h2>4. Myth 4: Detox Diets Are Necessary</h2>
                <p><b>Understanding the Body's Detoxification</b></p>
                <div class="content">
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>
                            The notion that we need detox diets to cleanse our bodies is a common myth. Our bodies are equipped with sophisticated organs, like the liver and kidneys, that naturally filter and eliminate toxins. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead of relying on detox diets, focusing on a balanced diet rich in whole foods, staying hydrated, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle is far more effective for supporting the body’s natural detoxification processes.
