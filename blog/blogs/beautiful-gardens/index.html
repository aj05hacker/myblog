                <div class="text">
                    <p>The Gardens of Versailles, located in Versailles, France, are among the most renowned and grandiose gardens in the world. Designed by landscape architect André Le Nôtre in the 17th century, these gardens are a prime example of French formal garden design, celebrated for their symmetry, order, and opulence. Spanning approximately 800 hectares (about 2,000 acres), the gardens were intricately planned to reflect the absolute power and grandeur of King Louis XIV's reign.</p>
                    <p>The gardens' layout is marked by a strict geometric order, featuring terraces, flower beds, lawns, and groves arranged in a perfectly symmetrical pattern. At the center of this design is the Grand Canal, a man-made waterway stretching over 1.5 kilometers, creating a stunning focal point. The gardens also boast an extensive collection of fountains, originally powered by innovative hydraulic machinery, with the Latona Fountain, depicting the myth of Latona, as one of its most famous features.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the grand open spaces, the gardens include several "bosquets" or wooded groves, each with its unique theme and design. These secluded areas were intended for intimate gatherings and leisurely strolls, offering a contrast to the expansive main gardens. The gardens' combination of formal and natural elements showcases the artistry of French Baroque design.</p>
                    <p>Visitors to the Gardens of Versailles can immerse themselves in the splendor of the French Baroque style, a testament to the cultural and artistic achievements of the French monarchy. The gardens are not only a symbol of royal power but also a cultural treasure, attracting millions of visitors from around the world who come to admire their beauty and historical significance.</p>
